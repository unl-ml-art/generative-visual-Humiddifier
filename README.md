## Abstract

For our generative visual project, I want to use CLIP Gan to visualize “the veil of the Internet.” I have been doing some projects trying to understand the impact of hyper gendering of women online. I came across the idea of the internet acting as a veil of anonymity, often used by women and non-binary people to protect themselves from the male gaze. I am hoping to write a few phrases that relate to this idea and CLIP Gan will visualize them. I am curious to see how CLIP imagines it, as this idea only exists online and it is unphysical. 

## Model/Data

I am hoping to use CLIP Gan and input phrases such as "A picture of the veil of the Internet," "A picture of a cyber veil," "a picture of a person breaking gender regulations," "androgyny in cyberspace," "sailing through cyberspace and spilling private information" ... etc 

## Code

I will upload the code here once images are generated
