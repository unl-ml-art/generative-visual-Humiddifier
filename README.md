## Abstract

For our generative visual project, I want to use CLIP BigGAN and DALL E to visualize “the veil of the Internet.” I have been doing some projects trying to understand the impact of hyper gendering of women online. I came across the idea of the internet acting as a veil of anonymity, often used by women and non-binary people to protect themselves from the male gaze. I am hoping to write a few phrases that relate to this idea and CLIP Gan will visualize them. I am curious to see how CLIP imagines it, as this idea only exists online and it is unphysical. 

## Model/Data

For the data input I chose to prompt Dall e and CLIP BigGAN in similar ways to see the different aesthetic outputs. For the Dall e result I prompted it with "Cyber Veil." For CLIP BigGan I prompted it first with "a picture of a Cyber Veil," then I referenced a quote from Gender and Privacy in Cyberspace by Anita L. Allen, where they reference "sailing through cyberspace and spilling private information." 

## Code

I used Dall e, https://colab.research.google.com/github/cedro3/others/blob/master/DALL_e_sample.ipynb#scrollTo=m4GLJKWaLzIg and CLIP BigGAN. 

## Results

The three pictures below are the results of my search for the visualization of "the veil of the Internet." I chose each of them because of their textural value but also the narrative within the images. I hope you enjoy!

## Technical Notes

I also tried many other phrases such as "androgyny in cyberspace," "a picture of a person who hides their face behind a computer," and "a veil concealing my gender" but I found that these results did not interest me in the same way that my picked results did.
